## Project

### Primary Goal
The main goal of the project is to release a modern easy to use tool to the mk community that will be built and owned by the community in an open source fashion.

### Secondary Goal
A secondary goal is to help aspiring developers & mk enthusiast to learn to contribute to an open source project while learning Vue.js and Typescript.

### Project Lead
Initially the project will be led by ctrlshiftba. I am looking for core contributors especially those with knowledge of blender or kicad. My goal as a lead is to make myself redundant and get the project up and running on it's own by the community without my involvement.
